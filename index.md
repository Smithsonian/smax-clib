The SMA information eXchange (SMA-X) is a high performance and versatile data sharing platform for distributed software
systems. It is built around a central Redis database, and provides atomic access to structured data, including 
specific branches and/or leaf nodes, with associated metadadata. The lead architect of SMA-X is Attila Kovács at the 
Center for Astrophysics \| Harvard &amp; Smithsonian.

The __smax-clib__ C/C++ client library was created, and is maintained, by Attila Kovács at the Center for Astrophysics 
\| Harvard &amp; Smithsonian, and it is available through the 
[Smithsonian/redisx](https://github.com/Smithsonian/smax-clib) repository on GitHub.
